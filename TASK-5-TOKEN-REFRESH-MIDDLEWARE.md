# Task 5: Token Refresh Middleware Implementation Summary

## Completed: Backend Middleware для автоматического обновления токенов

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Created RefreshTokenMiddleware
**File:** `backend_laravel/app/Http/Middleware/RefreshTokenMiddleware.php`

**Features:**
- Checks if the current token is about to expire (within 30 minutes)
- Automatically creates a new token with the same lifetime as the original
- Adds the new token to response headers (`X-New-Token` and `X-Token-Expires-At`)
- Deletes the old token after creating the new one
- Preserves the original token lifetime (8 hours or 30 days depending on "remember me")

**Logic Flow:**
1. Extract bearer token from request
2. Find token in database using Laravel Sanctum
3. Check if token expires within 30 minutes
4. If yes, create new token with same lifetime
5. Delete old token
6. Add new token to response headers
7. Continue with request processing

#### 2. Registered Middleware in Kernel
**File:** `backend_laravel/app/Http/Kernel.php`

Added middleware alias:
```php
'refresh.token' => \App\Http\Middleware\RefreshTokenMiddleware::class,
```

#### 3. Applied Middleware to Admin Routes
**File:** `backend_laravel/routes/api.php`

Applied `refresh.token` middleware to all authenticated admin routes:
- Authentication routes (logout, me, change-password)
- Blog post management routes
- Project category routes
- Project management routes
- Homepage content routes
- Service video routes
- Media page routes
- Media services routes
- Media service features routes
- Media service media routes
- Media testimonials routes
- Media process steps routes
- SEO management routes
- Image optimization routes

**Pattern used:**
```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'refresh.token'])->group(function () {
    // Protected routes
});
```

#### 4. Updated CORS Configuration
**File:** `backend_laravel/config/cors.php`

Added exposed headers to allow frontend to read the new token:
```php
'exposed_headers' => ['X-New-Token', 'X-Token-Expires-At'],
```

### How It Works

1. **Token Expiration Check:**
   - Middleware runs on every authenticated request
   - Checks if token expires within 30 minutes
   - Only refreshes if token is still valid (not expired)

2. **Token Refresh:**
   - Creates new token with same lifetime as original
   - Maintains "remember me" functionality (30 days vs 8 hours)
   - Deletes old token to prevent token accumulation

3. **Response Headers:**
   - `X-New-Token`: Contains the new bearer token
   - `X-Token-Expires-At`: ISO 8601 timestamp of expiration
   - Frontend can read these headers and update stored token

4. **Silent Refresh:**
   - Happens automatically without user interaction
   - No interruption to user workflow
   - Maintains session continuity

### Benefits

✅ **Automatic Token Refresh:** Tokens are refreshed 30 minutes before expiration
✅ **Seamless UX:** No interruption to user workflow
✅ **Security:** Old tokens are deleted immediately
✅ **Flexible:** Preserves original token lifetime (remember me support)
✅ **CORS Compliant:** Headers properly exposed for frontend access
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage:** Applied to all admin routes

### Testing Recommendations

To test the middleware:

1. **Login and wait:** Login to admin panel and wait until token is close to expiration
2. **Make API request:** Perform any admin action (e.g., edit project)
3. **Check response headers:** Look for `X-New-Token` header in browser DevTools
4. **Verify token update:** Confirm that subsequent requests use the new token
5. **Check database:** Verify old token is deleted and new token exists

### Next Steps

The middleware is now ready for frontend integration. The next tasks should:
- Create frontend hook to detect and store new tokens from headers
- Update API client to automatically use refreshed tokens
- Test the complete flow end-to-end

### Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend_laravel/app/Http/Middleware/RefreshTokenMiddleware.php` (created)
2. ✅ `backend_laravel/app/Http/Kernel.php` (updated)
3. ✅ `backend_laravel/routes/api.php` (updated)
4. ✅ `backend_laravel/config/cors.php` (updated)

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ Requirement 6.2: Автоматическое обновление токенов за 30 минут до истечения
✅ Requirement 6.4: CORS конфигурация для exposed headers
