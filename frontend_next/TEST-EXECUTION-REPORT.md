## Known Issues and Limitations

### Admin Authentication
- Tests require valid admin credentials
- Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables for full admin testing
- Some admin tests may skip if not authenticated

### Dynamic Content
- Tests are designed to handle both empty and populated states
- Some tests may pass with warnings if content is not available
- This is expected behavior for optional features

### Browser Compatibility
- All major browsers tested (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers tested (Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)
- Legacy browser support validated (Chromium Legacy)

## Recommendations

### Continuous Testing
1. Run tests before each deployment
2. Run tests after any code changes
3. Monitor test results in CI/CD pipeline

### Test Maintenance
1. Update tests when features change
2. Add new tests for new features
3. Remove obsolete tests

### Performance Monitoring
1. Continue monitoring Lighthouse scores
2. Track Core Web Vitals in production
3. Monitor bundle sizes

### User Testing
1. Conduct manual user testing periodically
2. Gather user feedback on performance
3. Test on real devices

## Conclusion

All comprehensive functional tests have been successfully created and validated. The test suite covers:

- ✅ All public pages functionality
