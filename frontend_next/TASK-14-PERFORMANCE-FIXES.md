# Task 14: Critical Performance Regression Fixes

## Summary

This document summarizes the critical performance fixes implemented to address regressions identified in the final performance report.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Home Page LCP (9.1s → Target: <2.5s)
**Problem**: Overly aggressive lazy loading of `HomeContentClient` was delaying hero section rendering.

**Solution**:
- Removed lazy loading wrapper (`HomeContentWrapper`) that was using `dynamic()` with `ssr: false`
- Made `HomeContentClient` render immediately on the server
- Hero content now loads without delay

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend_next/src/app/page.tsx` - Removed `HomeContentWrapper`, directly imported `HomeContentClient`

### 2. Home Page CLS (0.889 → Target: <0.1)
**Problem**: Layout shifts during content loading due to missing explicit dimensions.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit dimensions to hero image container with `aspectRatio: '1787/1810'`
- Added `minWidth` and `minHeight` to logo container
- Added `minHeight` to project images and their containers
- Created skeleton loader with exact dimensions for initial loading state

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend_next/src/app/HomeContentClient.tsx` - Added explicit dimensions and skeleton loader
- `frontend_next/src/components/HeroSkeleton.tsx` - Created (skeleton component with exact dimensions)

### 3. LCP Optimization on All Pages
**Problem**: LCP elements on various pages (About: 4.8s, Blog: 5.4s, Contact: 3.8s, Media: 6.1s) not optimized.

**Solution**:
- Added `priority={true}` and `fetchPriority="high"` to first visible images on each page
- Blog page: First blog post image now has priority
- Projects page: First project image now has priority and fetchPriority="high"
- About, Contact, Media pages already had priority set

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend_next/src/app/blog/BlogList.tsx` - Added priority to first blog post image
- `frontend_next/src/app/projects/ProjectsList.tsx` - Added fetchPriority="high" to first project

### 4. Media Page TBT (328ms → Target: <200ms)
**Problem**: Heavy carousel initialization blocking main thread.

**Solution**:
- Implemented IntersectionObserver to defer carousel initialization until needed
- Carousels now load only when they're about to enter viewport (200px margin)
- Reduced initial JavaScript execution time

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend_next/src/app/media/ServiceSection.tsx` - Added IntersectionObserver for lazy carousel loading
- `frontend_next/src/app/media/ServiceSection_mobile.tsx` - Added IntersectionObserver for lazy carousel loading

## Technical Details

### IntersectionObserver Implementation
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    (entries) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          setIsVisible(true);
          observer.disconnect();
        }
      });
    },
    {
      rootMargin: '200px', // Start loading 200px before visible
      threshold: 0.01,
    }
  );

  if (sectionRef.current) {
    observer.observe(sectionRef.current);
  }

  return () => observer.disconnect();
}, []);
```

### Skeleton Loader Pattern
- Exact dimensions matching final content
- Prevents layout shifts during loading
- Provides visual feedback to users

## Expected Impact

### Home Page
- **LCP**: 9.1s → <2.5s (significant improvement)
- **CLS**: 0.889 → <0.1 (meets target)
- **User Experience**: Immediate hero content visibility

### All Pages
- **LCP**: All pages should now meet <2.5s target
- **Consistency**: Priority loading for above-the-fold images

### Media Page
- **TBT**: 328ms → <200ms (meets target)
- **Initial Load**: Faster due to deferred carousel initialization
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Carousels load progressively as user scrolls

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run Lighthouse audit on all pages to verify improvements
2. Test on various network conditions (3G, 4G, WiFi)
3. Verify no layout shifts during page load
4. Check carousel functionality on Media page
5. Validate responsive behavior on mobile devices

## Next Steps

After validating these fixes:
1. Run comprehensive Lighthouse audits (Task 16.1)
2. Validate Core Web Vitals compliance (Task 16.2)
3. Create final validation report (Task 16.4)

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Skeleton loaders provide better UX during loading
- IntersectionObserver has excellent browser support
