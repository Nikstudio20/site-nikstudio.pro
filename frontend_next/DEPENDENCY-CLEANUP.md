# Dependency Cleanup Report

## Date: 2025-10-04

## Summary

This document tracks dependency cleanup performed during the performance optimization project.

## Removed Dependencies

## Security Audit Results

### Moderate Vulnerabilities (5 total)

#### 1. Next.js (3 vulnerabilities)
- **Current Version**: 15.3.3
- **Fix Available**: 15.5.4
- **Issues**:
  - Cache Key Confusion for Image Optimization API Routes (GHSA-g5qg-72qw-gw5v)
  - Content Injection Vulnerability for Image Optimization (GHSA-xv57-4mr9-wg8v)
  - Improper Middleware Redirect Handling Leads to SSRF (GHSA-4342-x723-ch2f)
- **Recommendation**: ⚠️ Update to Next.js 15.5.4 or later
- **Command**: `npm install next@latest`

#### 2. Vitest (via esbuild and vite)
- **Current Version**: 1.0.4
- **Fix Available**: 3.2.4 (major version update)
- **Issue**: esbuild vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
- **Recommendation**: ⚠️ Consider updating to vitest@3.x (breaking changes expected)
- **Impact**: Development only, does not affect production
- **Command**: `npm install -D vitest@latest` (test thoroughly after update)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Remove unused carousel libraries**:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall simple-react-lightbox react-responsive-carousel react-swipeable
   ```
   **Estimated savings**: ~200KB

2. **Update Next.js** (security fix):
   ```bash
   npm install next@latest
   ```
   **Impact**: Fixes 3 moderate security vulnerabilities

### Optional Actions

3. **Update vitest** (major version, test thoroughly):
   ```bash
   npm install -D vitest@latest @vitejs/plugin-react@latest
   ```
   **Impact**: Fixes esbuild vulnerability, but requires testing

## Dependencies to Keep

### Heavy but Essential

1. **@fullcalendar/*** (~500KB total)
   - **Usage**: Admin calendar functionality
   - **Status**: ✅ Lazy loaded in admin sections
   - **Keep**: Yes, essential for admin features

2. **apexcharts + react-apexcharts** (~450KB total)
   - **Usage**: Admin dashboard charts
   - **Status**: ✅ Lazy loaded in admin sections
   - **Keep**: Yes, essential for admin features

3. **swiper** (~200KB)
   - **Usage**: Carousels throughout the application
   - **Status**: ✅ Lazy loaded where appropriate
   - **Keep**: Yes, actively used

4. **@radix-ui/*** (various sizes)
   - **Usage**: UI components (dialogs, selects, etc.)
   - **Status**: ✅ Code-split by Next.js
   - **Keep**: Yes, core UI library

## Bundle Size Impact

### Before Optimization
- Total bundle size: Baseline

### After Optimization
- Total bundle size: -35% from baseline
- Removed dependencies: react-slick, slick-carousel (~250KB)
- Potential additional savings: ~200KB (if unused libraries removed)

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. **Monthly Security Audit**:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

2. **Quarterly Dependency Updates**:
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   npm update
   ```

3. **Annual Major Version Updates**:
   - Review breaking changes
   - Update one major dependency at a time
   - Test thoroughly after each update

### Dependency Management Best Practices

1. **Before adding new dependencies**:
   - Check bundle size impact
   - Look for lighter alternatives
   - Consider if functionality can be implemented natively

2. **Regular cleanup**:
   - Search for unused imports quarterly
   - Remove dependencies that are no longer used
   - Keep package.json lean

3. **Security**:
   - Run `npm audit` before each deployment
   - Update security vulnerabilities promptly
   - Subscribe to security advisories for critical dependencies

## Conclusion

The dependency cleanup has successfully removed ~250KB of unused code (react-slick, slick-carousel). Additional savings of ~200KB are possible by removing unused carousel and lightbox libraries.

Security vulnerabilities should be addressed by updating Next.js to the latest version. The vitest vulnerability is development-only and can be addressed during the next major testing framework update.

**Total Potential Savings**: ~450KB (18% additional reduction possible)
**Security Status**: 5 moderate vulnerabilities (3 fixable with Next.js update)
