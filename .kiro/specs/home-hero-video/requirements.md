# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will replace the static hero image on the home page with a video element that can be managed through the admin interface. The admin will be able to upload, replace, and manage the hero video with proper file size validation and error handling.

6. WHEN an admin wants to replace the current video THEN the system SHALL allow them to upload a new video file
7. WHEN a video upload is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message to the admin

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to see a preview of the current hero video in the admin interface, so that I can verify what visitors will see on the home page.
