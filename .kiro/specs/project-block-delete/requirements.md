# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add the ability to delete project blocks from the admin interface. Currently, users can edit project blocks and delete media groups within blocks, but there is no way to delete entire blocks. This feature will add a delete button next to the "Edit text" button for each block and implement the functionality to delete the block.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to be able to delete project blocks, so that I can remove content that is no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin views a project block THEN the system SHALL display a delete button next to the "Edit text" button
2. WHEN the admin clicks the delete button THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
3. WHEN the admin confirms the deletion THEN the system SHALL delete the block and all associated media
4. WHEN the block deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message
5. WHEN the block deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message
6. WHEN the admin cancels the deletion THEN the system SHALL close the confirmation dialog without deleting the block
