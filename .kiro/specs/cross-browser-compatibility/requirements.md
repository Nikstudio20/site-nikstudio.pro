# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on ensuring cross-browser compatibility across all pages of the portfolio/project showcase application. The goal is to make the application work consistently across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and their various versions while maintaining the existing design, layout, and functionality without breaking any current features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the website from any modern browser, I want all pages to display correctly and function properly, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN the page SHALL render with identical visual appearance
2. WHEN a user interacts with any UI component THEN the component SHALL behave consistently across all supported browsers
3. WHEN a user uploads files through any browser THEN the upload functionality SHALL work without browser-specific issues
4. IF a user uses an older browser version THEN the application SHALL provide graceful degradation without breaking core functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want CSS and JavaScript to be cross-browser compatible, so that I don't have to write browser-specific code or deal with browser-specific bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS properties are used THEN they SHALL be prefixed appropriately for cross-browser support
2. WHEN JavaScript features are implemented THEN they SHALL use polyfills or fallbacks for older browser versions
3. WHEN modern CSS features are used THEN they SHALL have fallback values for browsers that don't support them
4. IF a browser doesn't support a specific feature THEN the application SHALL provide an alternative implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user managing content, I want the admin interface to work consistently across all browsers, so that I can perform my tasks regardless of which browser I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin interface from any supported browser THEN all CRUD operations SHALL function identically
2. WHEN an admin uploads media files THEN the file upload process SHALL work consistently across browsers
3. WHEN an admin uses form components THEN validation and submission SHALL behave the same way in all browsers
4. WHEN an admin uses dialog components THEN they SHALL display and function properly across all browsers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user accessing the site from different mobile browsers, I want the responsive design to work consistently, so that I have the same mobile experience regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on mobile Safari THEN the responsive layout SHALL match the behavior on mobile Chrome
2. WHEN a user interacts with touch elements THEN they SHALL respond consistently across mobile browsers
3. WHEN a user views media content on mobile THEN videos and images SHALL display properly in all mobile browsers
4. IF a mobile browser has specific quirks THEN the application SHALL handle them without affecting the user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want automated tests to verify cross-browser compatibility, so that I can ensure consistent behavior across browsers without manual testing on every browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-browser tests are run THEN they SHALL verify visual consistency across supported browsers
2. WHEN functionality tests are executed THEN they SHALL confirm that all features work in each browser
3. WHEN CSS compatibility is tested THEN the tests SHALL identify any browser-specific rendering issues
4. WHEN JavaScript compatibility is tested THEN the tests SHALL catch any browser-specific JavaScript errors
